<h1>Sales Data Analysis & Product Recommendation System</h1>

<p>This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic product recommendation using retail sales data. The goal is to derive actionable insights to support business decisions and customer engagement strategies.</p>

<h2>📊 Project Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unit Price Analysis:</strong> Identified outliers in pricing, including anomalously high and negative unit prices, which may require correction or investigation.</li>
    <li><strong>Sales Distribution by Country:</strong> Found that the United Kingdom dominates sales volume, offering an opportunity for targeted marketing and logistics optimization.</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly & Weekly Sales Trends:</strong> Sales peak during November and December; mid-week days (especially Wednesday) have the highest transaction counts.</li>
    <li><strong>Hourly Sales Pattern:</strong> Most sales occur between 11 AM and 3 PM, highlighting key operational hours for staffing and promotions.</li>
    <li><strong>Cancellation Rate:</strong> Cancellations are low overall, but understanding causes can further improve customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛍️ Product Recommendation System</h2>
<p>A basic <strong>product recommendation system</strong> was also implemented within the notebook. Though preliminary, it demonstrates the capability to suggest related products, enhancing customer experience and increasing upselling opportunities.</p>

<h2>🚀 Business Impact</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Insights support better inventory planning, marketing timing, and operational optimization.</li>
    <li>Outlier detection can prevent revenue leakage due to pricing errors or fraud.</li>
    <li>The recommendation system paves the way for more advanced personalization in future work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📂 Files Included</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and visualizations</li>
    <li>Charts covering pricing, sales distribution, and temporal trends</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔧 Future Improvements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Refine the recommendation system using collaborative filtering or deep learning</li>
    <li>Automate outlier detection and alerting</li>
    <li>Develop a dashboard for real-time sales monitoring</li>
</ul>
